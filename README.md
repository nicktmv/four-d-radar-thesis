# 4d-radar-fyp-thesis

## Aim
To explore the theoretical methodology of achieving object detection from raw 4D radar point clouds

## Dataset Preparation

First, please request and download the View of Delft (VoD) dataset from the [VoD official website](https://tudelft-iv.github.io/view-of-delft-dataset/).

Please also obtain the tracking annotation from [VoD GitHub](https://github.com/tudelft-iv/view-of-delft-dataset/blob/main/docs/ANNOTATION.md). Unzip all the `.txt` tracking annotation files into the path: `view_of_delft_PUBLIC/lidar/training/label_2_tracking/`

The dataset folder structure should look like this:

```
view_of_delft_PUBLIC/
â”œâ”€â”€ lidar
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ ImageSets
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ testing
